Summary: In this post, I analyze apps in Google Play and Apple store to understand the type of apps that attract more users. Based on the analysis, a new app may be developed for english speaking users, which will be available for free on the popular app stores. The developers will earn revenue through in-app ads. The more users that see and engage with adds, the better.
